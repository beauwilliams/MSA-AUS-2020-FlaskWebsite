# Web Server

## If you want to run a website on a computer, you can't do it without one!

## NGINX is the most popular web server implementation today, although its neck and neck with **APACHE**

## Written in C, runs on UNIX, the last step before we get into *assembly*

## You can find NGINX powering roughly _30 percent_ of traffic today

## Its popularity is due in part to its open source nature, as well as its differing architecture compared to **APACHE**

## **Most Importantly** Azure sets this up for us in the background. No coding needed!
