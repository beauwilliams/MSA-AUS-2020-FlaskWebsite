# Web Server

Nginx is the most popular web server implementation today, although its neck and neck with **Apache**

You can find Nginx powering roughly _30 percent_ of traffic today

Its popularity is due in part to its open source nature, as well as its differing architecture compared to **Apache**

The success of Nginx is the result of an event driven architecture, combined with lightweight resource utilisation.

This makes it an excellent choice fo high bandwitdth services.

It runs on average 2.5x faster than Apache, which uses a process-driven architecture.
