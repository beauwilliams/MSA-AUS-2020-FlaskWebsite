# Web IO / Web Routing

## In order to interact between our application and web services we must use an *interface*.

### Python has its own defined interface known as WSGI - "Web Server Gateway Interface"

### Flask is built upon the WSGI - Defined by PEP \#3333 'Python Enhancement Proposal'

### It is considered a microservice framework designed to assist us in rapid application development

# The Python Based Alternative

Django is a heavier more feature backed alternative to flask that is also built upon WSGI.
